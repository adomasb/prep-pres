=======================================================

[Bike sharing demand:](https://www.kaggle.com/c/bike-sharing-demand)

Our task is to predict usage of bike sharing system for the following day. Therefore, patterns in usage should be revealed for good predictions.

One should notice that first one is strongly ahead. About 0.17 score difference from second competitor (not team!).

Moreover, distinction between the 30th competitor and 477th is about 0.11.

**Quite dense situation...**
